# Contributing to MappyPals

When contributing to this repository, check the Trello board (link on Discord) for available tasks. If the task is:

-   **Available**: Go ahead and claim the task, and proceed to work on a PR
-   **Claimed**: If someone else has claimed the task, speak with them or one of the project admin. PRs will only be accepted from the person that claimed that task.
-   **Non-Existant**: If the feature does not appear on trello, discuss it on Discord or speak with a project admin. There may be a good reason this feature is not listed.

The above is to ensure, everyone has the chance to get involved without waiting their time or rushing to add the feature.

Please also note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Trello Process

1. **Staging Area**

    - If you have an idea, suggestion or have found a bug in the project. Create a task with a detailed description, if it's a bug add photo, and steps on how to replicate it. We'll then discuss it in the task comment section or on discord. If its approved by the community it will be added to the `Tasks(current)` area. You can also assign yourself to the task, that way nobody could work on that task but you if its approved.

2. **Tasks (current)**

    - This is where you can find available tasks! If you are looking for a new challenge, select a task that excites you, assign your self to it and move it into the `In Progress` area.
    - **_NOTE_** - Don't take tasks that have already been assigned to someone, without their or a project admins approval.

3. **In Progress**

    - This is where tasks that are being worked on belong. Drag your task into this section, when you start working on it.
    - **_NOTE_** Check out the [PR Guide](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/mappypals/blob/master/pr-guide.pdf) by @Thijs, for more information on our forking/branching and keeping forks synced with the upstream.

4. **Review**

    - This is where tasks are place whilst the PR has been submitted and is awaiting approval. Once the code has been reviewed it will be merged and the task can be moved into the `Done` section.

5. **Done**
    - Tasks that have been completed, reviewed and merged can be found in this section.

## Pull Request Process

   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations etc.
2. Ensure the PR comment is documented with the changes you have made, for example `updated code` isn't really useful.
